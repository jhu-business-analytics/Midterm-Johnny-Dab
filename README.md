Contained is the analysis done comparing school attendance rates to vacancy rates.
## Baltimore's Broken Brownstone
Education is a nessary for the proper development of children but often times that can be ubstructed by variable means. The variable we worry about is the correlation of attendance at schools to vacant housing.

### Challenge/Problem section
  The question here is "Does Vacant Housing Affect Student Attendance Rate?" This should be known because in the city if Baltimore there are over 30,000 vacant buildings (jhunewsletter). What would happen if these unsused buildings had an affect on students going to school in some way? Based off of the data found here it can bee seens that vacant building rtaes have gone up and if these buildings do have an affects on the child, why not do something about it. This project is to see that a correlation can be found and if so to what degree.
  
### Solution section
  To solvw he business question we will used vacant building data that can be found at (https://data.baltimorecity.gov/) and we used excel to find the locations of every school in Baltimore. using that dat we were able to create a data set based in python and ecxel.We used a combination of linear regression in excel as well as SVM machine learning in Python to demonstrate that large drops in enrollment rates are associated with large increases in housing vacancies. Our process involved using geospatial coordinates of vacant houses as well as coordinates of schools to find the number of vacant buildings within a certain perimeter of each school in the City of Baltimore so we could then measure changes over time. 
  
### Suggestion section
  As of current, data proves that there is an inverse relation ship amongst students attendace rates and the vacany rates. Knowing this, we can bring this to the Department on Education so they will use this information for maybe future establishing of schools, finded better suited location, or getting the local governemtn to do something about the vacant buildings in the area.

Exploring your business question
I suggest picking a business question that’s related to Baltimore City, Baltimore City Government as a “business,” or another city government that you may be familiar with as a “business” since most major cities have well-populated open data portals, however, if you wish to explore a different business question, and you can find enough valid data to help you explore this topic, then you may pursue that topic. Here are some resources that might help you explore civic issues in Baltimore City and related resources:

Data Analysis
While you don’t (and shouldn’t) list out the entirety of your data analysis in your executive summary, you’ll need to upload your excel/Python/other data analysis work to your GitHub profile for a complete project. You don’t need to write up an explanation for each document you upload, but it should be clear what kind of analysis you conducted, why you chose this type of analysis, and your findings from each analysis uploaded. You can also upload data analysis that didn’t directly contribute to your business answer and suggestions to provide a robust background on your research. It should be clear to anyone in the class who isn’t in your group how you came to your data conclusions.

GitHub Issues and Projects
Utilize the GitHub Issues and Project feature to track your progress, collaborate with your team, and keep accounts of different resources and findings throughout your project. You can read more about submitting issues here, here, and here.

Executive Summaries
This write-up is similar to a business plan executive summary if your “service” is your business solution. While there are sentence/paragraph suggestions in each section, try to keep the written part of your executive summary to less than 2 pages typed in a Word document. Here are some good resources on business plans to learn more about why they’re important and how you should approach writing them:
